**NARG: A Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Large Language Model Approach for Neurosurgical Disease Diagnosis**

The Neurosurgical Medical Diagnosis Large Model Project (NARG) aims to enable disease diagnosis and knowledge-based question answering in the field of neurosurgery through large language model (LLM) methodologies. This project seeks to advance neurosurgical knowledge services and clinical decision support by developing LLMs tailored for neurosurgical tasks.

At present, for disease diagnosis tasks in neurosurgery, we have released **NRAG**, an instruction-tuned LLM specifically optimized for neurosurgical diagnosis applications.

## A Quick Start

1. Download the original *ChatGLM3-6B* model code and parameters, and configure the required dependencies (ChatGLM3-6B: [https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3)).
2. Download the NRAG model parameters and extract the checkpoint files into the directory: `ChatGLM3-6B/ptuning/`.
3. Following the *ChatGLM3-6B* project guidelines, load and activate the model using the training parameters from the specified checkpoint path.
